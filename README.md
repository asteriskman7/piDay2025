Estimate Pi by recognizing dice rolls (20x d6) and using probability density
function equation.

Pi = (1/2)*(1/(stddev*pdensity))^2

I rolled 300 times and got an estimate of 0.42...

I believe the main issue was poor dice recognition, often leading to only seeing
20 pips being detected. If that were fixed and about 1 million more rolls completed
I believe the result might become close to 3.1.
